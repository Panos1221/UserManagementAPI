# UserManagementAPI

UserManagementAPI is a simple and functional API built with ASP.NET Core, enabling CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing user records. This API comes with robust middleware implementations for logging, error handling, and authentication. This was made as a capstone project for the course:  [Back-End Development with .NET](https://www.coursera.org/learn/back-end-development-with-dotnet).
